# Image of the Day Picture Frame Project

I have built some DIY picture frames and given them to my extended family. The frames have a Pimoroni Inky Impression 7.3‚Äù eInk display (2025/Spectra 6 edition) and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.

I also have an HTTP endpoint on a publicly available server that will return a new image every day.

I want to write some code that will show a new photo on the frames each day. Every frame will display the same picture. Once a day, in the early morning, the code needs to download the photo and display it on the frame.

Can you help me design and implement the code to run on the Raspberry Pi?
